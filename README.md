# 🏆 World Cup Database Project

This project is part of the [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) **Relational Database Certification**. It involves building and interacting with a PostgreSQL database using Bash and SQL to track World Cup match data.

## 📖 About

The **World Cup Database** project challenges you to:

- Create and manage a relational database using PostgreSQL
- Import match and team data from CSV files
- Write SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data
- Use Bash scripting to automate data insertion and query execution

This hands-on project is a great way to learn database normalization, SQL queries, primary/foreign keys, and bash scripting for automation.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL** – relational database management
- **SQL** – for querying and managing data
- **Bash** – for scripting and automation
- **CSV** – as the source of input data

## 📁 Project Structure

- `worldcup.sql` – SQL file to create the database schema
- `insert_data.sh` – Bash script to insert data from `games.csv` and `teams.csv`
- `queries.sql` – SQL file containing required analytical queries
- `games.csv` – Match data including year, round, team names, and goals
- `expected_output.txt` – Used to validate correct SQL query results

## 🚀 Getting Started
